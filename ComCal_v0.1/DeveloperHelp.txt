This document is to help developers better understand the components of
ComCal.

-There are 3 main components within this project:
	MonthForm - responsible for reading the input from the user and
				displaying results such as show tasks and feedback.

	ComCalManager - executing basic commands(add,delete,edit, show,undo,redo,search)

	TextStorage - responsible for taking in initial info from text file
				  turning them into Tasks, sorting, update(only for todo file)
				  and transferring the vector of Tasks to ComCalManager

					
-Critical class types within ComCalManager and TextStorage(ComCalTypes):
	Task - formats a string into various components of index, description
		   start date and time, end date and time, location

	Date - formats a string into components of day,month,year and time(hhmm)


-ComCalHelper contains classes and headers that contains functions that aid in varios components:
	keywords - contains default keywords essential throughout ComCalComponents

	timeDateInfo - contains functions that will aid in checking the validity of
				   dates, time and clashes within Task

	typeConversions - functions to aid in conversions between types


Sequence of initialising application:

Main:
MonthForm form(numOfUserSpecifiedFiles, fileNames)
 |
 | - This form() initialises ComCalManager variable _manager(numOfUserSpecifiedFiles, fileNames)
 V
ComCalManger:
_manager(numOfUserSpecifiedFiles, fileNames) intialises below{
 |
 |TextStorage:
 | - Initialises  TextStorage _textEditor(todoFile, doneFile){
 |		- calls storeUpdateSortTasksInVec(todoFile) to store tasks in _todoVec in TextStorage.h
 |		- calls storeUpdateSortTasksInVec(doneFile) to store tasks in _doneVec in TextStorage.h
 |} 
 | - _textEditor->getSortedVec(todoFile) to initialise _todoTask vector in ComCalManger.h 
 | - _textEditor->getSortedVec(doneFile) to initialise _doneTask vector in ComCalManger.h
 |
 V
 ComCalManager initialised and program is ready for user input
 |
 |MonthForm::userEnter
 |- user inputs "add .d CS Tutorial .s 12/3/2015 1300 .e 12/3/2015 1400 .l NUS COM1 B1-03"
 V
 ComCalManager::deduceCommand(userInput, feedBack)
 |		^
 |		|returns feedBackMessage
 V		|
 ComCalManger::addMainCom(userInput)
 |
 |-userInput broken down into a Task and stored in _todoTask in ComCalManager.h
